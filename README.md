A captivating fantasy novel for readers of all ages by the author of Midnight s Children and The Satanic Verses This is simply put a book for anyone who loves a good story. It s also a work of literary genius. --Stephen King Set in an exotic Eastern landscape peopled by magicians and fantastic talking animals Haroun and the Sea of Stories inhabits the same imaginative space as The Lord of the Rings The Alchemist The Arabian Nights and The Wizard of Oz. Twelve-year-old Haroun sets out on an adventure to restore his father s gift of storytelling by reviving the poisoned Sea of Stories. On the way he encounters many foes all intent on draining the sea of all its storytelling powers.
